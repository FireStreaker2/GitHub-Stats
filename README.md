# About
GitHub Stats is a web app built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org). It's purpose is to check user and repository stats for GitHub, but also to help me get aquainted with Next. It utilizes the [GitHub API](https://api.github.com) in order to retrieve the stats, and then renders it with React.

# Usage
